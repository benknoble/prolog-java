 * Package holding prolog-parser code built for Comp 524 taught at the

 * The gateway should be considered {@link PrologParser}, {@link

 * see how they can be used together.
 *<p>
 * Then, write your own programs that consume {@link Program} to test for
 * certain aspects of the program-structure.
